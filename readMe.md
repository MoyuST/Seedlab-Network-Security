## about seedlab network security labs

recently, i reorganize and redo some of the labs in the seedlab network security labs. seedlab network security is a really high-quality course with detailed explaination on every topics it covered. and the most amazing part of this course is the elaborately designed labs which giving students the hands-on experience on the topics involved. i still remember for BGP attack, Prof. Du even implemented a small network system for its lab which really amazed me.
